# Startup School "Elevator Pitch"
Hard character limit on responses. 

## Company Name
Reread (Reflect, Remind, Advance)

## Describe your company in a sentence or two
App to help people be more consistent with self-improvement

## Vertical
Other

^ Note: surprisingly, this app didn't really fit into any of the other verticals listed

## What is your company going to make?
An app, then chat-bot & community for: people to note their motivations for habits they want to maintain/start/stop, to then be reminded of these reasons at critical moments, promoting adherence.

## Why did you pick this to work on?
It's something that we'd love to use, and I think many other people would benefit from it. I've used the techniques that this app fosters/enables with pen/paper, but lack of tech solution hindered adherence. Also scope for many feature additions.

## Which of the following best describes your progress?
Mocks/Renderings

## How far along are you?
Done so far: Several discussions/brainstorming sessions, ideas for layout of app and user journeys, quick (temporary) mock-ups, initial market research, discussions/plans of how the service would develop, and commercial strategy.

^ Note: we definitely need to do a lot more of the above (discussions, mock-ups, MVP goals, stretch goals...)
